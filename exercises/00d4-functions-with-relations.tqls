# Exercise 00d4: Functions Integrated with Relations
# Difficulty: Intermediate-Advanced
# 
# Task: Define functions that work with relations and complex schema patterns.
#       Show how functions can encapsulate business logic involving multiple entities.
# 
# Learning Goals:
# - Functions that traverse relations
# - Returning tuples from functions
# - Functions that create derived insights
# - Recursive function patterns
#
# Context:
# Tax logic often involves complex relationships:
# - Dependent qualifications based on relationship and support provided
# - Income attribution between spouses or business partners
# - Carry-forward losses from previous years
# - Multi-state income allocation based on time/presence
#
# Expected Result:
# Functions that encapsulate complex relational logic
#
define

# Example 1: Function checking if someone qualifies as a dependent
fun qualifies_as_dependent($taxpayer: taxpayer, $potential_dep: taxpayer) -> boolean:
    match
        # Check if there's a dependency relation
        dependency($taxpayer, $potential_dep) has support-percentage $support;
        $potential_dep has income $dep-income;
        # Dependent must have low income and high support
        ?dep-income < 4700;
        ?support > 50;
        let $qualifies = true;
    return first $qualifies;

# Example 2: Calculate total deductions from all sources (tuple return)
fun get_deductions_summary($taxpayer: taxpayer) -> double, integer, string:
    match
        filing($taxpayer, $form);
        deduction($form, $category);
        $category has amount $amount, has category-name $cat-name;
    reduce 
        $total = sum($amount),
        $count = count($category),
        $categories = first($cat-name);  # Example: would concatenate in real system

# Example 3: Stream function finding all related taxpayers
fun get_related_taxpayers($taxpayer: taxpayer) -> { taxpayer, string }:
    match
        { 
            dependency:supporter($taxpayer) isa dependency,
                relates $dependent as dependency:dependent;
            $dependent isa taxpayer;
            let $relationship = "dependent";
        } or {
            joint-filing:primary($taxpayer) isa joint-filing,
                relates $spouse as joint-filing:spouse;
            $spouse isa taxpayer;
            let $relationship = "spouse";
        } or {
            partnership:partner($taxpayer) isa partnership,
                relates $partner as partnership:partner;
            $partner isa taxpayer;
            not { $partner = $taxpayer; };
            let $relationship = "business-partner";
        };
    return { $dependent, $relationship };

# Example 4: Recursive function to calculate carry-forward losses
fun calculate_total_carryforward($year: integer, $taxpayer: taxpayer) -> double:
    match
        # Base case: find losses for the given year
        carryforward-loss($taxpayer, $year) has amount $loss;
        # Recursive case: add previous year's carryforward
        let $previous-year = $year - 1;
        {
            ?previous-year >= 2019;  # Stop at 2019
            let $previous-carry = calculate_total_carryforward($previous-year, $taxpayer);
            let $total = $loss + $previous-carry;
        } or {
            let $total = $loss;
        };
    return first $total;

# TODO(human): Define this function:
# fun calculate_household_income($taxpayer: taxpayer) -> double, integer:
#    Calculate total household income including:
#    1. Taxpayer's own income
#    2. Spouse's income (if joint filing exists)
#    3. Dependent's income (if any dependents)
#    Returns: (total_income, number_of_people)
#    Hint: Use pattern disjunction { } or { } to handle different cases
