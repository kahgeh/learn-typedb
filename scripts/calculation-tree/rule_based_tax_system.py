"""
Rule-Based Tax Calculation System in TypeDB

This demonstrates TRUE semantic correctness by:
1. Encoding tax calculation rules in the schema
2. Using TypeDB inference to automatically derive calculations
3. Showing calculation paths WITHOUT needing taxpayer data
4. Ensuring calculations follow tax law semantics

The system defines:
- Tax calculation formulas as schema rules
- Automatic lineage tracking through inference
- Queryable calculation paths independent of data
