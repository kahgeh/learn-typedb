Demonstration of Semantic Correctness in TypeDB

This script shows how TypeDB ensures semantic correctness through:
1. Schema-level constraints and relationships
2. Calculation dependencies modeled as first-class concepts
3. Tax rules encoded as queryable data (not hard-coded logic)
4. Ability to show calculation structure WITHOUT taxpayer data

Key difference from the audit trail approach:
- The audit trail just RECORDS calculations after they happen
- This approach ENCODES the rules for HOW to calculate

This demonstration shows TRUE semantic correctness:

1. **Calculation Rules as Schema**: The formulas and dependencies are
   part of the schema, not just recorded after calculation.

2. **No Taxpayer Data Needed**: We can query and understand the entire
   calculation structure without any taxpayer data.

3. **Dependencies are Explicit**: The schema enforces that Federal Tax
   cannot be calculated without Taxable Income, which cannot be
   calculated without AGI, etc.

4. **Tax Rules as Data**: Tax brackets and deductions are queryable
   data, not hard-coded logic. Changes to tax law = data updates.

5. **Semantic Validation**: The system knows WHAT each field means
   and HOW it relates to others, preventing nonsensical calculations.

Compare to the audit trail approach:
- Audit trail: Records calculations AFTER they happen
- This approach: Defines HOW calculations SHOULD happen
- Audit trail: Needs taxpayer data to show structure  
- This approach: Structure is visible without any data
