Setup TypeDB Database with Audit Trail Schema and Sample Data

This script:
1. Creates or recreates the tax-system database
2. Defines the audit trail schema
3. Inserts sample taxpayer data
4. Executes auditable calculations to create the lineage tree
5. Verifies the setup is ready for visualization

Run this before visualize_calculation_tree.py
